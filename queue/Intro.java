    // A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In, First-Out
    // (FIFO) principle. üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚û°Ô∏èüö∂‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è This is like a real-life queue at a checkout
    // counter, where the first person in line is the first person to be served.

    // Core Operations
    // The primary operations for a queue are:

    // Enqueue: Adds an element to the back (or "rear") of the queue. Think of it as
    // joining the end of the line.

    // Dequeue: Removes an element from the front of the queue. This is like the
    // person at the front of the line being served and leaving.

    // Peek/Front: Lets you look at the element at the front of the queue without
    // removing it. It shows who's next in line.

    // Unlike stacks, which use a Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) approach, queues are
    // used in scenarios where the order of processing is important, such as
    // managing print jobs, handling network requests, or implementing breadth-first
    // search (BFS) algorithms.
