    // What is Backtracking?

    // Backtracking is a systematic way to solve problems by exploring every
    // possible path to a solution. If a path leads to a dead end or doesn't satisfy
    // the problem's constraints, the algorithm "backtracks" (undoes its previous
    // step) and tries a different path. It's a methodical form of trial and error
    // often used to find all possible solutions to a problem.

    // A backtracking algorithm typically has the following components:

    // A state that represents the current progress toward a solution.
    // Choices at each state that lead to new states.
    // Constraints that determine whether a choice is valid.
    // A goal that indicates a solution has been found.
