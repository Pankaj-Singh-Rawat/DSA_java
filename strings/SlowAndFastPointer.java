        // The Fast and Slow Pointers technique uses two pointers that traverse a data
        // structure (usually a linked list or an array) at different speeds. This
        // pattern is incredibly effective for solving problems involving cycles or
        // determining the length of a data structure.

        // The two main scenarios are:

        // Finding/Detecting a Cycle: The fast pointer moves two steps at a time, and
        // the slow pointer moves one step at a time. If there's a cycle, the fast
        // pointer will eventually "lap" the slow pointer and they will meet at some
        // point inside the cycle.

        // Finding a Specific Position: The pointers move at different speeds until one
        // reaches a certain condition (e.g., a fast pointer reaching the end of a list
        // to find the middle element).
