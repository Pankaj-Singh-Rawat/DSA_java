/*
To implement a Graph we will use an Adjacency Matrix

The Adjacency Matrix is a 2D array (matrix) where each cell on index (i,j)
stores information about the edge from vertex i to vertex j.

In case we have a 'sparse' Graph with many vertices, we can save space by using an
Adjacency List compared to using an Adjacency Matrix, because an Adjacency Matrix would
reserve a lot of memory on empty Array elements for edges that don't exist.
