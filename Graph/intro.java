What is a Graph?
A graph is a data structure that consists of:
Vertices (V): Also called nodes - the entities
Edges (E): Connections between vertices

Notation: G = (V, E)

Types of Graph:
1. Directed Graphs (Digraphs)
    A → B → C
    ↓
    D
2. Undirected Graphs
    A — B — C
    |
    D
3. Weighted Graphs
     A -5→ B -3→ C
     ↓2
     D
4. Unweighted Graphs
    A → B → C
    ↓
    D
5. Cyclic Graphs: Graph that contains at least a single cycle is called cyclic graph.
6. Acyclic Graphs: Doesn't contain any cycle in the graph.
7. Connected Graphs: There's a path between every pair of vertices
8. Disconnected Graphs: There's no path.
