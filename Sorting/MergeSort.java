/*
Merge Sort - a classic divide-and-conquer algorithm known for its stability and guaranteed O(n log n) performance!

How Merge Sort Works
Merge Sort follows a simple strategy:

Divide: Split the array into two halves
Conquer: Recursively sort both halves
Combine: Merge the two sorted halves into one sorted array

Time Complexity:
Best: O(n)
Avg: O(n log n)
Worst: O(n log n)
