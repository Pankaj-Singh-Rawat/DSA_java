/*
A Binary Heap is a complete binary tree where:

Max Heap: Every parent node is ≥ its children (root is maximum)
Min Heap: Every parent node is ≤ its children (root is minimum)

Heap Sort has two main phases:Phase 1: Build Max Heap
Convert the unsorted array into a max heapPhase 2: Sort
Repeatedly:

Swap root (maximum) with last element
Reduce heap size by 1
Heapify the root to restore heap property
Repeat until heap size = 1
