    // Why Trees?

    // Trees represent hierarchical data, a concept not possible with linear
    // structures like arrays, stacks, or queues. This makes them ideal for a wide
    // range of applications, including:

    // File Systems: The directories and subdirectories on your computer are
    // structured as a tree.

    // Organizational Charts: A company's management hierarchy is a classic example
    // of a tree structure.

    // Databases: Many database systems use tree-like structures (like B-trees) to
    // efficiently store and retrieve data.

    // Key Tree Concepts

    // When you start learning about trees, you'll encounter new terminology:

    // Root: The topmost node of a tree. A tree has only one root.

    // Node: An individual element in the tree that holds data.

    // Child/Parent: A node directly below another is its child, and the node above
    // is its parent.

    // Leaf: A node at the very bottom of the tree that has no children.

    // Traversals: These are methods for visiting every node in a tree. The three
    // main types are:

    // In-order

    // Pre-order

    // Post-order
}
